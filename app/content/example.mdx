# Welcome to the Example MDX File

This is a basic example of an MDX file. You can use Markdown syntax to write content, and also import and use React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you use JSX syntax within your Markdown content. This allows you to create dynamic and interactive content.

## Example Usage

You can import and use React components directly within your MDX file. For example:

\`\`\`jsx
<Button>Click me</Button>
\`\`\`

This will render a Button component from your components library.
