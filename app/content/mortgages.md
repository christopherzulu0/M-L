# Understanding Mortgages

A mortgage is likely to be the biggest financial commitment you'll ever make. Here's what you need to know:

## Types of Mortgages

1. **Fixed-Rate Mortgages**: The interest rate remains the same for the entire loan term.
2. **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)**: The interest rate can change periodically.

## Key Terms

- **Principal**: The original amount of the loan.
- **Interest**: The cost of borrowing money.
- **Down Payment**: The initial upfront portion of the total amount due.

## Tips for Getting a Mortgage

1. Check your credit score and report before applying.
2. Save for a larger down payment to potentially get better rates.
3. Shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders.
4. Consider getting pre-approved to strengthen your buying position.

Remember, a mortgage is a long-term commitment. Make sure you understand all the terms before signing.
